# Haskell

  Haskell is a computer programming language. In particular is a polymorphically statically typed, lazy, purely functional language, quite
  different from the most other programming languages. The language is named for Haskell Brooks Curry, whose work in mathematical logic 
  serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on lambda calculus, hence the lambda we use as a logo.

  Functional programming is based on the idea of calculation. We define for ourselves the functions to be used, and the implementation will calculate
  the valuesof expressions which use these functions, just as a traditional calculator will calculate arithmetical expressions like those given here:
  (7-3)*(4+2) = 4 * (4+2) = 4*6 = 24
  A functional program, or script as it is called in Haskell, consists of a number of definitions of functions and other values such as numbers and pairs.
